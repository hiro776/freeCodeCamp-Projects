                    C was invented and first implemented by Denis Ritchie on a DEC PDP-11 that used
                    the Unix operating system. C is the result of a development process that started
                    with an older language called BCPL. BCPL was developed by Martin Richards, and it
                    influenced a language called B, which was invented by Ken Thompson. B led to
                    the development of C in the 1970s.
                </p>
                <p>
                    C is often called a <em>middle-level</em> computer language. This is because it
                    combines the best elements of high-level languages with the control and
                    flexibility of assembly language. As a middle-level language, C allows the manipulation
                    of bits, bytes, and addresses--the basic elements with which the computer functions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    C is a compiled language. This means the raw C code first must be converted into raw
                    intructions, i.e. the <em>machine code</em>, before it can be run by the computer.
                    A general build process is like this:
                <ul>
                    <li>A compiler reads the entire C program and converts it into <em>object code</em></li>
                    <li>Then, a linker takes this object code and links it with its dependencies (standard library and
                        other
                        user-defined functions) to create a final <em>executable file</em>.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    Many people confuse the C with C++. Originally, C++ was build on top of C 
                    and added my features to the C language by Bjarne Stroupe. One of the most 
                    notable feature was support for Obejct-Oreintation with the class keyword. 
                    For this reason, C++ was initially called as the "C with classes".
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, mordern C++ and C are completely different languages in many respects. 
                    C++ is still backward compatible with C (C89 standard), the new c++14 and above is 
                    now mostly used which can feel like a completely different programming language to 
                    a C veteran.
                </p>
                <p>
                    C was designed Originally for system programming, and its simplicity and strength made 
                    it suitable for almost anything. On the other hand, was designed to provide C with <em>Object-Orientation</em> 
                    support. C is much simple and light weight language as compared to C++.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It would be more helpful to think of them as very closely related languages, but different.

                To get started with C, open any text editor and write your first code:
                <pre>
<code class="block">
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    
    int main() 
    {
        printf("Hello, world\n");
        
        return 0;
    }
</code>
                </pre>
                Now, save it as <code>hello.c</code>. Open the terminal, and compile and run:
                <pre>
<code class="block">
    $ gcc -o hello hello.c
    $ ./hello
    Hello, world
    $

            <article>
                <p>
                    A <em>variable</em> is a named location in memory that is used
                    to hold a value that can be modified by the program. That is,
                    a variable is a human-readable form of physical computer address.
                    The names of variables is called <em>identifier</em>---which are
                    completely used-defined.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The length of these identifiers can vary from one to several characters.
                    The first character must be a letter or an underscore, and subsequent
                    characters must be either letters, digits or underscores. Here are some examples:
                    <table>
                        <thead>
                            <tr>
                                <th>Correct</th>
                                <th>Incorrect</th>
                            </tr>
                        </thead>
                        <tbody>
                            <tr>
                                <td>count</td>
                                <td>1count</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>test23</td>

                <p>
                    In C, all variables must be declare before they
                    can be used. The general form of a declaration is
                    <pre><code class="block">   <em>type variable_list</em>;</code></pre>
                    Here, <em>type</em> must be a valid data type plus any modifier,
                    and <em>variable_list</em> may consist of one or more identifier names
                    separated by commas. Here are some declarations:
                    <pre>
<code class="block">
    int i, j, l;
    short int si;
    unsigned int ui;
    double balance, profit, loss;
</code>
                    </pre>
                </p>
                <p>Remember, in C the name of a variable has nothig to do with its type.</p>

            <article>
                <p>
                    When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable,
                    because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a
                    variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Variables delared in local scope are not accessible outside that function.
                    <pre>
<code class="block">
    void func1(void)
    {
        int x = 10;
    }

    /* this will produce an error,
     * because no variable
     * x exist in this scope */
    printf("%d", x);

            <article>
                <p>
                    Unlike local variables, <em>global variables</em> are known
                    thoughout the program and may be used by any piece of code.
                    Also, they will hold their value thoughout the program's execution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To declare global variable, declare variables outside of any logical block, ie outside of function,
                    while, for, etc.

                <p>
                    <em>Constants</em> refer to fixed values that the program
                    may not alter. Unlike normal variables, constants are read-only variables.
                    And therefore, their value cannot be changed after their definition. A
                    constant variable can have any data type.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can create constant variables by using <code>cosnt</code> keyword.
                    <pre>
<code class="block">
    const double PI = 3.14156;
</code>
                    </pre>
                    By convention, constant types are named with all uppercase letters.

                    C89 defines five foundational data types:
                    <ul>
                        <li>character ---- declared using <strong>char</strong> keyword</li>
                        <li>integer ---- declared using <strong>int</strong> keyword</li>
                        <li>floating-point ---- declared using <strong>float</strong> keyword</li>
                        <li>double floating-point ---- declared using <strong>double</strong> keyword</li>
                        <li>valueless ---- declare using <strong>void</strong> keyword</li>

                    You can use if...else statements to program logical execution that will be executed
                    only if some certain condition(s) are met. Syntax:
                    <pre>
<code class="block">
    if (condition)
    {
    statement(s)
    }
    else
    {
        statement(s)
    }
</code>
                    </pre>
                    if condition evaluates to true, the first statements will be executed, otherwise
                    on false, second statements are executed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can have multiple branches which each execute when a certain condition is met using
                    if...else if...else statement.
                    <pre>
<code class="block">
    if (condition)

    /* any number of else if */
    else
    {
        statement(s)
    }
</code>
                    </pre>
                    The trailing else block is executed if all of the conditions evalutes to false.

                    A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. Syntax:
                    <pre>
 <code class="block">
    while (condition)

        statement(s)
    }

                    </pre>
                    If the condition evaluates to false then the execution of the while loop stops, and the control
                    flow passes to the statement following the while loop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An example to print first 20 integers on the screen:
                    <pre>
<code class="block">
    int i = 0;
    while (i < 20)

        printf("%d\n", i+1);
        i++;
    }
</code>
                    </pre>
                    With each iteration the loop increments the i adding 1 to it. When i = 20, the mentioned condition
                    evaluates to false and the loop stops.
